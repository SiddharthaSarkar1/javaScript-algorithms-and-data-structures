//However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

const s = [5, 6, 7];

console.log(s);

//s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error. After commenting out that line, the console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].

//An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignments.
